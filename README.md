## Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions: A Data Science Approach

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project aimed at predicting whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on historical data. This project utilizes a data science approach encompassing data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and logistic regression modeling. 

### Introduction

The Bank Marketing Data Set, used in this project, provides insights into direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. The dataset encompasses customer demographics, financial information, and campaign details, allowing us to analyze factors influencing a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. 

### Project Goals

* **Predict Term Deposit Subscriptions:** Develop a model capable of accurately predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
* **Identify Key Factors:** Analyze the dataset to understand the key features that influence subscription decisions.
* **Improve Marketing Strategies:** Provide actionable insights to enhance the bank's marketing campaign effectiveness.

### Methodology

The project consists of the following structure:

1. **Data Exploration and Understanding:**
    * Load and overview the dataset.
    * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the features and their relationships.
    * Analyze data distributions and identify potential data quality issues (e.g., missing values).

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
    * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    * Handle missing values by removing rows with "unknown" values.
    * Engineer new features by binning the "age" feature into age groups.
    * Prepare data for modeling by scaling numeric features and encoding categorical features.

3. **Baseline Model: Dummy Classifier:**
    * Establish a baseline model using a Dummy Classifier that always predicts the majority class.
    * Evaluate the Dummy Classifier's performance through accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
    * Utilize cross-validation to obtain a more robust performance estimation.

4. **Developing a Predictive Model:**
    * Construct a preprocessing pipeline to automate data preparation steps.
    * Train a Logistic Regression model and perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
    * Evaluate the model's performance on the held-out test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    * Analyze the confusion matrix and interpret the results.
    * Utilize cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

5. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
    * Summarize the findings and highlight the model's performance.
    * Provide business insights based on the model's analysis, suggesting potential improvements to marketing strategies.
    * Outline potential future work to enhance the model's performance and address remaining challenges.
